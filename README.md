# gallery-react
A test for react-webpack from gallery-react

This is a new version of https://github.com/materliu/gallery-by-react.git.

Because of code genetaed by generator-react-webpack in ES6 style, the original code can NOT be used directly in this framework.

So I fixed all problems in ES6 style.

1 installation

git clone https://github.com/ford25v6/gallery-react.git

2 Dev-env setup

cd YOURPATH/gallery-react

npm install

npm start

That's all.

Or you can play with it directly by open file "YOURPATH/gallery-react/dist/index.html".

Enjoy it!
